# data_funicular
This tool is for data visualisation.
A lot of times I work with excel sheets and python's standard library (i.e I cannot install new packages, programs, etc). This is a solution to alleviate this pain

The idea here is to give the script some csv files and it should create a html page with dygraph elements inside
